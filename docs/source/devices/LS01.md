### LS01

The Dragino LSE01 is a LoRaWAN Soil Moisture & EC sensor module that is
designed to measure the soil moisture of saline-alkaline and loamy soil. This is
quite similar to the LHT65, works as a data logger and as a wireless sensor for
network applications. The device specifications are the following.

This device is powered by a 8500mA Li-SOCI2 battery that is designed to make it autonomous for more than 10 years. Using the same spreadsheet from Dragino, with the same uplink intervals as the LHT65, it is possible to obtain the battery lifetime expectation for this device, given the datarate. Table \ref{tab:les01} shows that the highest battery lifetime expectation is lower than LHT65 but it suffers less energy consumption from datarate changes than LHT65, lasting 45\% less when changed from datarate 5 to 0. The reason why the datarate has lower influence here is the fact that the sensors from this device consumes more energy while measuring, making the datarate change less relevant in total.
